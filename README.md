This project uses a Linear Regression model to predict used car prices based on their age, mileage, and model.

The notebook covers the full machine learning workflow: loading and visualizing the data with Pandas and Matplotlib, splitting it into training and testing sets with Scikit-learn's train_test_split, and then training and evaluating the model.
